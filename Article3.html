        <p class="par">The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" four-wheel drive option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.

            Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. It remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.</p>
            <h2>First generation (W202; 1993)</h2>
            <p class="par">In October 1986, three years into Mercedes-Benz 190 (W201)'s production run, work began on a successor. Design work began in 1987, with the final design by Murat Günak selected in 1989 and the production design by Olivier Boulay delayed in January 1990, finally being patented on 19 December 1990.[1][2][3][4] Rough prototypes went into testing in 1989, with first production design prototypes commencing trial in 1990. In May 1993, the first generation W202 C-Class was introduced as a replacement for the 190. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was manufactured on 1 June 1993. The C-Class sedan was the company's entry-level model up until 1997 when Mercedes launched the A-Class. Styling themes were carried over from the previous W201 series, but the new series had a smoother and rounder design than the last generation of compact Mercedes, with styling cues from the W124 E-Class (short, high trunk and taller tail lights), W140 S-Class (front end), and R129 SL-Class (headlights).

                During the 1996 and 1997 Formula 1 season, the C36 AMG served as the sport's Safety Car.[5]</p>
