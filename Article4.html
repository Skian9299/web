        <P class="par">The Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W204) is the third generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. It was manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz in sedan/saloon (2007–2014), station wagon/estate (2008–2014) and coupé (2011–2015) bodystyles, with styling by Karlheinz Bauer and Peter Pfeiffer.

            The C-Class was available in rear- or all-wheel drive, the latter marketed as 4MATIC. The W204 platform was also used for the E-Class Coupé (C207).[8]</P>
        <P class="par">Typically, Mercedes offered the W204 in three trim and equipment levels, marketed as Classic, Elegance and Avantgarde. The base trim, marketed as Classic, was offered with smaller four-cylinder engines and cloth seats or optional leatherette, marketed as ARTICO. Elegance trim featured standard leatherette upholstery with optional leather. The Avantgarde offered Liverpool fabric/leatherette seats or optional leather. Classic and Elegance retained a traditional Mercedes-Benz grille, with horizontal chrome bars and standing hood emblem. Avantgarde trim featured a 'sport' grille with three wide matt-finish horizontal bars and a large, central emblem as well as an optional AMG bodykit, sport seats, three-spoke sport steering wheel, lower and stiffer sports suspension, upgraded brake piston calipers, and larger alloy wheels. W204s advertising predominantly featured the sport grille and AMG bodykit, especially in Canada and the United States.

            The W204 line offered a range of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, a 3.5-litre V6 petrol and a 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine are also available. The AMG variant, marketed as the C 63 AMG used the 6.2-litre V8 petrol engine.[14]
            
            In the United Kingdom, the Classic trim level was marketed as the SE, and the Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package was marketed as the Sport.</P>
        <p class="par">In the United States, the Elegance trim is only available on the C 300 Luxury with an option for the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, and the Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package is available on the C 300 Sport (the only US market C-Class with a standard manual transmission with 4MATIC system available as an option) and the C 350 Sport (RWD only). There were no Classic/SE trim models, no models with four-cylinder or diesel engine, and no station wagon models available in the US market. Both trims featured required US amber side reflectors and lights.

            The Canadian market offered only the AMG Line trim level; four-cylinder models along with station wagon models were also not offered. The base C 230 model (renamed the C 250 from the 2010 model year) was exclusive to the Canadian market and is the only model that has amenities similar to the Elegance/Luxury trim with the traditional grille and three-point star hood ornament. The other C-Class models (C 300, C 350 and C 63 respectively) offered the AMG bodykit and sport grille as standard. These amenities were available as an CAD800 option for the C 230 model as the Sport Package (which rises to CAD1200 for the 2011 model year due to the new LED fog lights).
            
            All models except for the C 63 AMG, are available in both Rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive (4Matic)</p>
